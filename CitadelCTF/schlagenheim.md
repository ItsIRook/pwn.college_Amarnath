Your quest continues, but you feel something odd about this room. The only artifact on this floor is a corrupted file held in the hands of a jet-black statue, frozen in the pose of a band mid-performance. The passcode to the next floor is hidden within this piece of music, but it canâ€™t be played, as if the wrong extension has scrambled it.

You must take the corrupted file and repair it to reveal the true code that will unlock the door forward.

## How I solved
- The given file has the extension set as .wav but opening it in a hex editor to view its bytes, you notice that it has magic bytes that say M1D1 which hints towards it being a MIDI file (along with hints from challenge name & description).
- The magic bytes in the header that say M1D1 have to be changed to MThd as that is the file header for a MIDI file.
- After making the modifications, saving it and opening it in a software that can visualize MIDI such as Audacity, the flag is shown.
Flag: `citadel{8lackM1D1wa5c00l}`
