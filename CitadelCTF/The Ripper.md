# The Ripper
The guardian of this floor steps from the shadows. Known only as Jack the Ripper, he watches you carefully. He proclaims himself merciful and hands you a word list to help. He asks you to find the passcode hidden in this hash $2a$04$RNoyoWAcW0StwSri4YN1Eeb2j1gBNKutDOMxsLzfyfSvB/ghMHToa. The word list is your only aid. Only by combining the two correctly can you uncover the key and move on to the next floor. Flag format: `citadel{password}`

## How I solved
- hash format can be found out by using an online tool.
- hash format -> bcrypt, password is `fake_flag_4_fake_pl4y3rs`

flag : `citadel{fake_flag_4_fake_pl4y3rs}`
