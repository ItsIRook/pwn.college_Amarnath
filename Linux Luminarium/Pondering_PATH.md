# üîπ The PATH Variable

In this level, the challenge program tries to `rm /flag`. If the shell can't find `rm` because the `PATH` is empty, the removal fails and the challenge rewards you with the flag.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{EyODGUp4JJiq-4efeDk8rrCVXNs.QX2cDM1wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I removed the directories from my shell's `PATH` so child processes couldn't locate `rm`.
* Then I executed the challenge program; its attempt to remove `/flag` failed because `rm` couldn't be found.
* The challenge noticed the failure and printed the flag.

```bash
# Clear PATH in the current shell so child processes inherit it
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
# Now the challenge can't find rm
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!

```

### üìö What I Learned

* The shell searches for commands using the `PATH` environment variable (a colon-separated list of directories).
* Child processes inherit the parent's environment, so clearing `PATH` in your shell prevents programs you launch from finding external commands like `rm`.
* Manipulating `PATH` can be a powerful tool ‚Äî for defense (sandboxing) or exploitation ‚Äî but be careful: blanking `PATH` breaks many useful commands.

# üîπ Setting PATH

This level practices using the `PATH` environment variable to make programs callable by their bare names. The `win` command lives in `/challenge/more_commands/`, so placing that directory into `PATH` (or replacing `PATH` with it) lets you run `win` directly.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{I0JVrTzKTb52gm5d9FbL5YSBdFT.QX1cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I set `PATH` so the shell would search `/challenge/more_commands/` for commands:

```bash
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
```

* Then I ran the challenge; it invoked `win` by bare name and printed the flag:

```bash
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
pwn.college{I0JVrTzKTb52gm5d9FbL5YSBdFT.QX1cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}
```

### üìö What I Learned

* `PATH` is a colon-separated list of directories the shell searches for executables when you type a bare command name.
* Overwriting `PATH` with a directory that contains the desired program makes that program invokable without a full path.
* Be careful when changing `PATH`: replacing it entirely can make many standard commands unavailable; prefer prepending/appending when appropriate (e.g., `PATH=/my/bin:$PATH`).

# üîπ Finding Commands

In this challenge you must locate a `win` program that was placed somewhere in your `$PATH`. The `which` command searches each directory in `$PATH` in order and prints the first matching executable it finds. Once you locate `win`, use its directory path to `cat` the adjacent flag file.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{I96x_IlsFoYRt072ychGVs2uDwD.01NzEzNxwCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I used `which win` to discover where `win` lives.
* I read the flag file in the same directory with `cat`.

```
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ which win
/challenge/paths/26958/win
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ cat /challenge/paths/26958/flag
pwn.college{I96x_IlsFoYRt072ychGVs2uDwD.01NzEzNxwCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned

* The shell executes the first matching executable it finds by scanning each directory listed in `$PATH` (unless the command is a shell builtin).
* Use `which <name>` to see precisely which file would run when you type a command name.
* Once you have the full path to an executable, you can inspect other files in the same directory (for example, a `flag` file) by using that path.

# üîπ Adding Commands

In this challenge you must create a `win` command in a directory on your `$PATH` so that `/challenge/run` (which runs as root) calls it. Because `/challenge/run` will search `PATH` for `win`, place your script in a directory and set `PATH` so that `win` is found. Use a shell builtin (`read`) to avoid needing `/bin/cat` when you overwrite `PATH`.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{Ahk3qsStoNr5xv7Zm46b2LDxaxB.QX2cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* Created a directory for custom commands: `mkdir /tmp/mybin`.
* Wrote a small `win` script that uses the bash `read` builtin to read `/flag` and print it.
* Made the script executable with `chmod +x /tmp/mybin/win`.
* Exported `PATH` to point to the new directory so `/challenge/run` would find `win`.
* Ran `/challenge/run` which invoked `win` and printed the flag.

```
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ mkdir /tmp/mybin
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ cat > /tmp/mybin/win <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
read -r FLAG < /flag
printf '%s\n' "$FLAG"
EOF
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ chmod +x /tmp/mybin/win
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ export PATH=/tmp/mybin
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
pwn.college{Ahk3qsStoNr5xv7Zm46b2LDxaxB.QX2cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@path~adding-commands:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned

* You can inject custom commands by creating a directory with executables and placing it in `PATH`.
* Overwriting `PATH` can hide standard utilities; use absolute paths or shell builtins (like `read`) to avoid losing functionality.
* `/challenge/run` executed `win` as root; by providing `win` we can control what it does (in this case, print the flag).

# üîπ Hijacking Commands

In this challenge the program attempts to delete `/flag` using `rm`. Because the shell looks for `rm` in the directories listed in `$PATH`, you can provide your own `rm` that instead prints the flag. Place your fake `rm` in a directory and run `/challenge/run` with `PATH` set so your `rm` is found first.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{sNYTtpe75KJ1BiHrfRGHtQKyJhr.QX3cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* Created a directory for custom commands: `mkdir -p /tmp/mybin`.
* Wrote a small `rm` script that reads `/flag` using the `read` builtin and prints it.
* Made the script executable with `chmod +x /tmp/mybin/rm`.
* Ran `/challenge/run` with `PATH` set so that `/tmp/mybin` is searched first.

```
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ mkdir -p /tmp/mybin
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ cat > /tmp/mybin/rm <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
read -r FLAG < /flag
printf '%s\n' "$FLAG"
EOF
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ chmod +x /tmp/mybin/rm
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ PATH=/tmp/mybin /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
pwn.college{sNYTtpe75KJ1BiHrfRGHtQKyJhr.QX3cjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned

* You can hijack system utilities by placing executables with the same name earlier in `$PATH`.
* Overwriting `PATH` can hide standard utilities; use builtins or absolute paths if needed.
* When a privileged program invokes a command by name, controlling `PATH` can let you control what that program runs.
