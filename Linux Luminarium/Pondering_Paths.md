# üîπ Implicit Relative Paths, From /
In this challenege, the user uses cd command to get into `/home` to run the command `run` from `/challenge/run`.

### üè¥ Flag
`pwn.college{gB7PN_WzBxh2hhzJmx3MGa9iyHj.QX5QTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved
- I simply typed `cd /` in the terminal.
- I invoked `/challenge/run`.
- The command was executed and the flag was displayed.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gB7PN_WzBxh2hhzJmx3MGa9iyHj.QX5QTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$
```

### üìö What I Learned
- I learned how to access a file in some location using relative path.
- Imagine we want to access some file located at /tmp/a/b/my_file.

  - If my cwd is `/`, then a relative path to the file is `tmp/a/b/my_file`.
  - If my cwd is `/tmp`, then a relative path to the file is `a/b/my_file`.
  - If my cwd is `/tmp/a/b/c`, then a relative path to the file is `../my_file`. The .. refers to the parent directory.

---
# üîπ Explicit Relative Paths, From /
In this challenege, the user uses cd command to get into `/` to run the command `run` from `./challenge/run`(the idea is to use `.`.

### üè¥ Flag
`pwn.college{sZtVJ2yDVy4Hx5imCCNCcWoR1eQ.QXwUTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved
- I simply typed `cd /` in the terminal.
- I invoked `./challenge/run`.
- The command was executed and the flag was displayed

```
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sZtVJ2yDVy4Hx5imCCNCcWoR1eQ.QXwUTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$
```

### üìö What I Learned
- I learned that in most operating system, every directory has implicit entries that you can reference in paths: `.` and `..`. The first, `.`, refers right to the same directory, so the following absolute paths are identical to each other: 
  - `/challenge`
  - `/challenge/.`
  - `/challenge/./././././././././`
  - `/./././challenge/././`
- The following relative paths are also all identical to each other:
  - `challenge`
  - `./challenge`
  - `./././challenge`
  - `challenge/.`

---
# üîπ Implicit Relative Paths

In this challenge, you must run run from the /challenge directory. Linux does not search the current directory for programs when you type a naked command name (like run) ‚Äî that would be unsafe. To explicitly execute a program in the current directory you must use . in the path (for example ./run).

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{E-Q08MPtzdkfJ6TDecp7Dk5CyxY.QXxUTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

- I changed into the `/challenge` directory with cd /challenge. 
- I invoked the program with an explicit relative path: `./run`.
- The program ran and printed the flag.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E-Q08MPtzdkfJ6TDecp7Dk5CyxY.QXxUTN0wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$
```

### üìö What I Learned

- Linux avoids implicitly searching the current directory for commands when you give a naked path (e.g. run) as a safety measure.

- To explicitly execute something in the current directory you must prefix it with `./` (dot-slash).

- `.` refers to the current directory; `..` refers to the parent directory. Using `./program` removes ambiguity and tells the shell you mean the program in the current directory.

---
# üîπ Home Sweet Home

In this challenge you must provide an argument (three characters or less before expansion) that expands to an absolute path inside your home directory. Bash expands a leading `~` to your home directory (`/home/hacker`), so `~/a` becomes `/home/hacker/a` and satisfies the constraints.

### üè¥ Flag
`pwn.college{UerExeWBXmW8YUOK3GcA_dgs_lY.QXzMDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved
- I ran the program with an argument that uses ~ as shorthand and is three characters before expansion: `/`challenge/run `~/a`.
- /challenge/run wrote the flag to `/home/hacker/a` and printed the flag.

```
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{UerExeWBXmW8YUOK3GcA_dgs_lY.QXzMDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned
- `~` expands to the user‚Äôs home directory (/home/hacker) only when it appears at the start of a path.
- `~` expansion happens before the program sees the argument, so passing `~/a` satisfies an "absolute path" requirement after expansion.
- cd with no arguments returns you to your home directory; `~` is a convenient shorthand for home.

---
# üîπ removing files

Files can pile up; `rm` removes them. Be careful‚Äî`rm` permanently deletes (no recycle bin). Basic usage:

```
rm filename
```

In this challenge, a file named `delete_me` is created in your home directory. Remove it, then run `/challenge/check` to verify and receive the flag.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{QqAmkIOoJsIN9MfN5alnv0cdgmm.QX2kDM1wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I removed the file using `rm delete_me`.
* I ran `/challenge/check`, which confirmed the removal and printed the flag.

```
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{QqAmkIOoJsIN9MfN5alnv0cdgmm.QX2kDM1wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned

* `rm <file>` deletes a file‚Äîthere is no undo in the shell.
* Use caution with `rm`, especially with wildcards or `-r` for recursive deletion.
* After removing a required file, challenge checkers can verify and reward you.

---
# üîπ moving files

`mv` renames or moves files. Usage:

```bash
mv source target
```

This challenge asks you to move `/flag` into `/tmp/hack-the-planet`, then run `/challenge/check` to verify and reveal the reward.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{YGyLeMkC2F8e9KQPUS2vi7pgm9T.0VOxEzNxwCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I moved the flag with `mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet`.
* I ran `/challenge/check`, which confirmed the move and printed the flag.

```
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{YGyLeMkC2F8e9KQPUS2vi7pgm9T.0VOxEzNxwCO0gjNzEzW}
```

### üìö What I Learned

* `mv <src> <dst>` moves or renames files and directories.
* Ensure the target path exists or that you specify the desired filename.
* Moving system files may require appropriate permissions.

---
# üîπ hidden files

Files beginning with a `.` are hidden from `ls` by default. Use `ls -a` to show all entries, including `.` and `..` and dotfiles.

In this challenge the flag is hidden as a dot-prefixed file in the filesystem root. List `/` with `ls -a`, locate the dotfile, and `cat` it to read the flag.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{cF6Gm-oHxYwzC02eGkB1QSw_yit.QXwUDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I listed the root directory including hidden files with `ls -a /`.
* I found the dot-prefixed file (`.flag-179121076127016`) and used `cat` to read it.

```
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ ls -a /
.   .dockerenv             bin   challenge  etc   lib    lib64   media  nix  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
..  .flag-179121076127016  boot  dev        home  lib32  libx32  mnt    opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ cat /.flag-179121076127016
pwn.college{cF6Gm-oHxYwzC02eGkB1QSw_yit.QXwUDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$
```

### üìö What I Learned

* `ls -a` shows hidden files (dotfiles) and the `.` and `..` entries.
* Hidden files are simply filenames that start with `.`; they are not magically protected.
* Use `ls -a` when you suspect a file might be hidden.

---
# üîπ An Epic Filesystem Quest

This challenge is a puzzle hunt using `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`. Start at `/`, find a file named `LEAD` (or similar), `cat` it to get a clue that points to the next location, and repeat until you reach the flag.

Each clue may have special requirements:

* **Trapped** clues must be read without `cd`-ing into their directory (use absolute paths).
* **Hidden** clues are dotfiles and require `ls -a` to see them.
* **Delayed** clues become readable only after you `cd` into their directory.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{kEDX9gVxXUjn2qN5alysNYNEwPB.QX5IDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

1. Read the first clue in `/`:

   ```
   cat /LEAD
   # -> Lucky listing!
   # -> The next clue is in: /usr/share/locale/kl/LC_MESSAGES
   ```
2. Read the trapped clue without `cd`:

   ```
   cat /usr/share/locale/kl/LC_MESSAGES/SPOILER-TRAPPED
   # -> Tubular find!
   # -> Next: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.30.0/Devel (hidden file)
   ```
3. List hidden files and read the dotfile:

   ```
   ls -a /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.30.0/Devel
   # -> .HINT present
   cat /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.30.0/Devel/.HINT
   # -> Lucky listing! Next: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/72x72/stock/image
   ```
4. Continue following clues and obeying hints (use `ls`, `ls -a`, `cat`, and `cd` when instructed):

   * `cat /usr/share/icons/hicolor/72x72/stock/image/NUGGET` ‚Üí next: `/var/cache/man/hr` (hidden file `.REVELATION`)
   * `cat /var/cache/man/hr/.REVELATION` ‚Üí next: `/opt/pwndbg/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cryptography/hazmat/bindings/__pycache__` (delayed)
   * `cd` into that directory and `cat CUE` ‚Üí next: `/opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/mips/fw/lib` (trapped)
   * `cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/mips/fw/lib/README-TRAPPED` ‚Üí next: `/usr/share/doc/bash/examples`
   * `cat /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/TIP` ‚Üí next: `/usr/lib/R/library/base/help` (trapped)
   * `cat /usr/lib/R/library/base/help/TEASER-TRAPPED` ‚Üí reveals the flag.

### üìö What I Learned

* Use `ls` to inspect directories and `ls -a` to reveal dotfiles.
* Use `cat /path/to/file` to read files without changing directories.
* Follow instructions in clues carefully ‚Äî some require `cd`, some forbid it, and some are hidden.
* Combining these commands lets you traverse and inspect the filesystem reliably to find hidden content.

---
# üîπ finding files

`find` walks directory trees and lists files that match criteria. By default it searches `.` (the current directory) and prints every file it finds. You can provide a location and a test, for example:

```bash
find / -name flag
find my_directory -name my_subfile
```

The filesystem is large and some directories will print "Permission denied" ‚Äî ignore those; the flag won't be hidden in places you can't access.

### üè¥ Flag

`pwn.college{Mabe3DUBmp4Bd-VQ3quKbQPclpb.QXyMDO0wCO0gjNzEzW}`

### ‚ö° How I Solved

* I ran `find / -name flag` to search the whole filesystem for files named `flag`.
* The command printed many candidate paths and some permission errors (expected).
* I inspected the readable candidates with `cat` until one returned the real flag.

Notes:

* Some `flag` paths were directories ‚Äî `cat` on those fails with "Is a directory".
* Ignore permission denied errors; they are expected when scanning system directories.

### üìö What I Learned

* `find` is powerful for locating files by name, type, timestamp, size, and many more criteria.
* When searching the whole filesystem, expect and ignore permission-denied messages.
* Once you get candidate paths, use `cat` (or `ls -l`) to inspect which ones actually contain the flag.
