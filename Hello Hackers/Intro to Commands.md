# Intro to Commands
### In the challenge the user invokes their first command i.e "hello".

Flag: pwn.college{Ieswv42nQuGHzh3QQicda3luFuf.QX3YjM1wCO0gjNzEzW}

I solved the given challange by typing in "hello" in the terminal, which then invoked the command and displayed the flag.

### what I learned
I learnt how to invoke a command and that Linux terminal is case sensitive as only "hello" worked not "HELLO".
